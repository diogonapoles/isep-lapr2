# US 010 - Register Employee

## 1. Requirements Engineering

### 1.1. User Story Description

As an **administrator**, I want to register an **Employee**.

### 1.2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications

Every Employee has only one role (Coordinator, Receptionist, Nurse).

Every employee must have the following attributes; Id (automatic), Name, address, phone number, e-mail, Citizen Card number, and all these attributes are mandatory.
### 1.3. Acceptance Criteria

AC1: Each user must have a single role defined in the system.

AC2: The "auth" component available on the repository must be reused (without modifications).

### 1.4. Found out Dependencies

To complete each operation inside the program the user must have some permissions to access certain information that is given to them when the administrator registers the employees.
the US10 should be able to cooperate with other US especially with US 11 because to complete certain tasks u need to have permissions determined by the US 10

### 1.5 Input and Output Data

**Input Data:**
* Typed data:
    *  name
    *  phone number
    *  address
    *  email address
    *  citizen card number

* Selected data:
    * Employee Role

**Output Data:**
* (In)Success of the operation

the input data are the name, phoneNumber, address, emailAddress, citizenCardNumber, and the system must show the success of the operation to the user.

### 3.1. Rationale

**The rationale grounds on the SSD interactions and the identified input/output data.**

| Interaction ID | Question: Which class is responsible for... | Answer                     | Justification (with patterns)                                                                                                           |

| Step 1  		     | 	...interacts with the user 						          | RegisterEmployeeUI         | Pure Fabrication: the attribution of this this responsibility cannot be justified for any class of the domain module                    |

| 		             |	... validating all data (local validation)? | Employee                   | IE: an object knows its data                                                                                                            |

### Systematization ##

According to the taken rationale, the conceptual classes promoted to software classes are:

* Company
* Application
* Employee

Other software classes (i.e. Pure Fabrication) identified:
* RegisterEmployeeUI
* RegisterEmployeeController
* EmployeeStore

Other software classes of external systems/components:

* AuthFacade

# 4. Tests
*In this section, it is suggested to systematize how the tests were designed to allow a correct measurement of requirements fulfilling.*

**_DO NOT COPY ALL DEVELOPED TESTS HERE_**

**Test 1:** Check that it is not possible to create an instance of the Example class with null values.

	@Test(expected = IllegalArgumentException.class)
		public void ensureNullIsNotAllowed() {
		Exemplo instance = new Exemplo(null, null);
	}

*It is also recommended to organize this content by subsections.*

# 5. Construction (Implementation)

*In this section, it is suggested to provide, if necessary, some evidence that the construction/implementation is in accordance with the previously carried out design. Furthermore, it is recommeded to mention/describe the existence of other relevant (e.g. configuration) files and highlight relevant commits.*

*It is also recommended to organize this content by subsections.*

# 6. Integration and Demo

*In this section, it is suggested to describe the efforts made to integrate this functionality with the other features of the system.*


# 7. Observations

*In this section, it is suggested to present a critical perspective on the developed work, pointing, for example, to other alternatives and or future related work.*
